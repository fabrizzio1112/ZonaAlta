            <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
            <p>If you are a buyer - Let us help you find your perfect property. Whether you are a first time buyer or an experienced investor; we are here to help. From the initial search to the signing of deeds. It is our goal to make the process as efficient and pleasant as possible, so we do not stop there, we also offer you our incomparable post-purchase service. <br> <br>
              Once you have made the purchase - We can help manage your apartment, house or building. Many of our clients live out of town and rely on our dedicated team to manage their properties. If you need a tenant, an electrician, or just want someone to take care of the plants; let our family be an extension of yours. <br><br>
              If you are a seller - We select and market the properties we represent with great care, accuracy and honesty. The Barcelona property market can be opaque and misleading; the prices of properties for sale are frequently inflated, final closing prices are rarely known, and properties can remain on the market for months. If you are interested in selling and want to know more about our specialized approach - Let's talk.</p>

            <h3>HOW DO WE DO IT</h3>
            <p>We believe in providing exceptional service with extraordinary attention to detail. <br> <br>
              There are hundreds of real estate agencies and thousands of agents in Barcelona. Less than 10% have the API qualification contemplated within the umbrella of Spanish Law. Our API Diploma dictates that we operate with the highest levels of expertise and integrity. It also gives us access to valuable tools, data, and other resources that allow us to better evaluate and negotiate a potential purchase or sale. <br><br>
              Unlike most agencies, we do not accept commissions or rewards from the professionals we refer to you. If we help you with a banker, lawyer, architect or other professional, you can be sure that the recommendation is made with your best interests in mind. <br><br>
              We continue to work with many of the same clients that we had from the beginning. Since then, we have continued to add new relationships, all of them special. Whether it's our unique real estate approach or simply our ability to keep everyone happy, we have an entire community of clients who refuse to work with anyone else.</p>
